A cascaded control structure consisting of an outer optimal control loop and inner PID loop is proposed for regulation of the pressure in an EWR. Additionally, two potential strategies for disturbance rejection in the outer loop are proposed and validated, and it is shown analytically that the outer loop is mean-square stable under arbitrary packet loss if a Try-Once-and-Discard transmission protocol is assumed. The proposed control strategy offers control of EWR pressure with a steady-state error that is asymptotically bounded by the error in the disturbance estimate.

Future work should examine more sophisticated disturbance rejection policies, and modern delay-compensating control strategies such as the work of Krstic and Bresch-Pietri \cite{Bresch-Pietri2010} could be explored to improve pump control.
