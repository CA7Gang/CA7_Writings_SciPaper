A cascaded control structure consisting of an outer optimal control loop and inner PI loop, as well as leakage detection and disturbance rejection based on a harmonic consumer demand model and Kalman filter, is proposed for regulation of the level in an EWR and validated experimentally. Performance is excellent but highly tuning-dependent, with poor tuning leading to coupled oscillatory behaviour. Furthermore, steady-state oscillations are seen in the inner loop, and likely cannot be eliminated without a decoupling scheme. Leakage detection, however, remains robust even when controller performance is suboptimal.
