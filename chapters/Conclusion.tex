A cascaded control structure consisting of an outer optimal control loop and inner PID loop is proposed for regulation of the level in an EWR and validated experimentally. Additionally, leakage detection and disturbance rejection based on a harmonic model and Kalman filter is proposed and experimentally validated, with results suggesting that performance is highly tuning-dependent.
