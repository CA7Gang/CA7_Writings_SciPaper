The control strategy proposed is presented in \cref{fig:tikzControlStrat} and includes two distinct control-loops; one for handling the fast dynamics, i.e. the pumps and one for handling the slow dynamics, i.e. is the pressure in the tank.

A Linear quadratic regulator (LQR) outputs a flow reference to a PI controller based on the residual between tank pressure reference and actual tank pressure. The PI controls gives a reference speed to the pumps based on.....
